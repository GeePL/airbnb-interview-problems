# Airbnb Coding Problems

## Intro

This repo consists of several solutions of mine to the coding problems, which appear in Airbnb's tech interviews with high frequency.

Please debug the main method of every problem's solution class for testing. I didn't use test frameworks like JUnit because you have to manually enable the assertion in VM parameters.
